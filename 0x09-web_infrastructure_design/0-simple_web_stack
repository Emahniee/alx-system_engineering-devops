2. Explain the issues with this infrastructure:
A. There are multiple SPOF(Single port of failure) in this infrastructure. If any one of the components fails, the entire site would be down.
B. Downtime during maintenance:
When there is a need for site maintenance on any of the system components, that component has to be put down or the entire server turned off. Since there is only one server, the website will experience downtime.
C. Cannot scale if there is too much traffic:
It would be difficult to scale this system because one server contains the required components. The server can quickly run out of resources or slow down when it starts receiving a lot of requests.
